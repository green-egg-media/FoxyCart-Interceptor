The FoxyCart Interceptor is middleware that intercepts the FoxyCart XML Datafeed and hands it off to as many scripts as you need.

Description:
	Intercepts the FoxyCart XML Datafeed and hands it off to two or more other URLs for processing.
	This allows a single datafeed to be used by more than one script.
	A response of "foxy" is returned to FoxyCart only if ALL secondary scripts return "foxy" to the interceptor.

How to Use:
	Step 1: Upload the Interceptor
	#	Upload this file to your server.
	#	This file needs to live somewhere that is directly web-accessible, i.e., it is not CMS-dependant, and
		is not served out by a CMS.
	
	Step 2: Set your URLs
	#	Add each URL to the $urls array.
	
	Step 3: Tell FoxyCart where to send the XML
	#	In your FoxyCart Admin panel, point the XML datafeed to this script.
	
	Step 4: TEST
	#	Test that everything is working correctly.
	#	Test that everything is working correctly.
	#	Test that everything is working correctly. (Yes, test three times!)

IMPORTANT NOTES:
	*	Interceptor does not decrypt your datafeed, it only passes it along to additional scripts, so your
		scripts need to do their own decoding.
	*	FoxyCart expects a response of "foxy" when the datafeed is sent, otherwise it will mark that feed
		as failed. Interceptor will only return "foxy" if all of the subsidiary scripts return "foxy" to
		Interceptor. Otherwise, Interceptor will return the entire response of each subsidiary script.
